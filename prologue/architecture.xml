  <title>LFS Target Architectures</title>

<para>The primary target architectures of LFS-ARM are the ARM and ARM64 CPUs.
For other ARCHs refer to the main LFS book or CLFS as a historical reference.
To build a system that utilizes one of these CPUs, the main prerequisite, in
addition to those on the next page, is an existing Linux system such as an
earlier LFS installation, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or other distribution
that targets the architecture that you have. Also note that a 32-bit
distribution can be installed and used as a host system on a 64-bit ARM
unoptimized computer.</para>
